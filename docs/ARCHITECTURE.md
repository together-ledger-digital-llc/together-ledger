# Architecture

## Two explicit operating modes

Together Ledger preserves the inspected browser-local starter while adding an authenticated private-sync service. The UI always identifies the active boundary as **Browser only**, **Account ready**, or **Private sync**.

```text
Browser-only mode                         Private-sync mode
─────────────────                         ─────────────────
UI ──► validated state ──► localStorage    UI ──► same-origin Fastify API
                  └──────► JSON export              │
                                                     ├──► PostgreSQL
                                                     ├──► SMTP relay
                                                     └──► HMAC event chain
```

Signing in never uploads an existing browser ledger. A signed-in person deliberately creates a new private journey. Cloud snapshots remain in memory and are never written into browser-only ledger storage; signing out restores the untouched local ledger. Server authorization remains the source of truth.

## Components

- `index.html` contains semantic application and account dialogs.
- `src/styles.css` contains the responsive, 16-theme visual system.
- `src/model.js` contains calculations and local validation.
- `src/store.js` owns browser persistence, migration, and JSON backup/restore.
- `src/api.js` is a configurable-origin, cookie-authenticated API client. It remains same-origin by default for the public demo and switches to `api.together-ledger.com` only when the deployment meta configuration is set.
- `src/app.js` renders both modes and maps authoritative snapshots into the established UI model.
- `server/app.js` applies origin, session, CSRF, rate-limit, cookie, and HTTP security boundaries.
- `server/platform.js` owns authorization and transactional domain operations.
- `server/migrations/` defines PostgreSQL records and append-only event protection.
- `server/security.js` owns Argon2id password hashing, opaque token hashes, CSRF derivation, and canonical HMAC events.
- `server/mailer.js` sends verification, invitation, and recovery links through an owner-configured SMTP relay.
- `server/billing.js` isolates Stripe-hosted web billing, test/live guards, Customer reuse, Checkout sessions, verified webhook projection, and provider-neutral entitlements.

## Billing and entitlement boundary

Direct web purchases use Stripe-hosted Checkout and Stripe Billing. The first two people in a journey are included; one $1 USD monthly subscription per paid journey holds an integer quantity for additional-person capacity. The application never accepts raw payment credentials and never grants capacity from a browser redirect. A signed webhook updates Stripe subscription and invoice records, then projects the provider state into a journey-scoped entitlement used for capacity decisions.

Apple App Store and future Google Play purchases remain separate provider transactions. Their verified notifications will feed the same entitlement shape without becoming Stripe charges. The provider record remains auditable even when multiple valid sources overlap. The current code implements the Stripe adapter and an operator-invoked current-object reconciliation path; store adapters and an operating protected reconciliation schedule remain explicit non-live boundaries.

## Account and sharing boundary

Each journeyer has a separate email/password account and a unique private username. Registration does not ask for a name: the username is the initial account label and is not shown to the other journeyer by default. Names used together belong in the shared journey, where they can be chosen with context rather than demanded during sign-up. Usernames are normalized, validated in the application, and unique in PostgreSQL so web, mobile, AWS, and GCP clients all receive the same answer. A journey owner sends an email-bound, hashed, expiring invitation. Acceptance requires a signed-in account with that verified email. Verification, recovery, and invitation emails preserve the already allowlisted browser origin that initiated the action, with an owner-configured fallback reserved for trusted non-browser jobs. Database authorization is repeated inside every mutation transaction; journey IDs are never treated as authority.

The public/default service continues to allow two people. A non-production `test-groups` mode exercises synthetic groups up to the internal safety ceiling, and a separate billing mode can derive additional capacity from a verified entitlement only when billing is explicitly enabled. Every live invitation reserves one place until it is accepted, revoked, or expires. Journey settings retain the server-authoritative creation time, membership join times, and invitation destination, sender, time, and lifecycle state for authorized members. Raw invitation tokens and the internal ceiling are never returned. Downloaded backups replace internal account IDs with consistent aliases created only for that export, preserving attribution without publishing live identifiers. Removing a member requires the owner. Sharing a login is unsupported because it destroys actor attribution.

## Concurrency and synchronization

Journeys, expenses, moments, and concerns carry integer versions. Edits submit the version last read. A stale write receives `409 conflict`; the UI must refresh instead of silently overwriting another journeyer’s work. Invitation reservation and acceptance both take the same per-journey PostgreSQL advisory lock; the capacity calculation counts active members plus separately expiring live reservations, preventing concurrent requests from crossing the boundary. The snapshot returns shared-now moments plus private and share-later moments created by the requesting account. Every moment mutation repeats that same authorization inside the transaction, returning `404` instead of revealing a non-shared record to the other journeyer. Private and share-later moments may move between those two creator-only states or become shared now. A shared-now moment cannot return to a private state because prior access cannot be undone. The preset list includes promises, acknowledgments, triggers, missed chances, heart-to-heart talks, memories, feelings, boundaries, repair requests, things learned, calls requested or received, practical matters, and an intentional `other` record whose required short label is chosen by the journeyers and rendered as **Add your own moment** in the interface.

PR#0003 is online-first. Durable offline mutation queues and merge semantics are not claimed.

## Server-authoritative Event Manager

The same PostgreSQL transaction that changes a journey record appends its event. Per-journey advisory locking produces one monotonic sequence. Every event includes the authenticated actor, action, entity, bounded before/after evidence, previous hash, and HMAC hash. PostgreSQL rejects event update and deletion; the only exception is a transaction-local flag used to purge a sole-owner journey during required account deletion.

Private and share-later moments stay outside the shared HMAC event chain. Their creator-only visibility changes are stored in a separate bounded record containing no moment text. Deliberately sharing one appends a privacy-bounded shared event. Expense event snapshots intentionally omit notes, payment-account labels, and references. Concern and shared-moment event snapshots record whether free-text context existed, not its text. This retains an undebatable change trail without duplicating the most sensitive free text indefinitely.

HMAC chaining is tamper-evident, not absolute immutability. A party controlling the database and HMAC secret could forge a chain. Secret isolation, encrypted cross-cloud backups, restricted roles, restore drills, and external evidence are still required.

## Deletion behavior

Deletion verifies the password and revokes sessions and account tokens. A sole-member journey is purged. An owner must deliberately transfer every shared journey before deleting their account; ownership is never assigned by an arbitrary join-time rule. A non-owner departure removes that account's non-shared moments and creator-only visibility records, retains a privacy-bounded deletion event, and removes the membership. The deleted user row is pseudonymized so historical actor identifiers do not become dangling personal email records.

## Deployment

The application is one portable container backed by standard PostgreSQL. AWS is the low-volume primary writer; GCP is a cold standby restored from separately encrypted cross-cloud backups. This avoids unsafe dual writes and keeps the system operable by one owner. See [OPERATIONS.md](OPERATIONS.md).

The existing GitHub Pages build remains a static browser-only deployment until DNS is intentionally moved to the authenticated service. A PR merge alone must never be represented as activating private sync.
