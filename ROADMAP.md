# Roadmap

## Now — safe public starter

- Local-first relationship-resilience journeys
- Synthetic demo data
- A timeline for memories, feelings, boundaries, acknowledgments, repair requests, and practical matters
- Visibility cues and non-judgmental guided check-ins
- Conversations to return to and mutually understood next actions
- Optional money context without totals, balances, rankings, or relationship scoring
- Lossless preservation of legacy trip and expense records as practical-context moments
- JSON backup and restore
- Automated tests and public-safety scan
- Multiple local journeys and switching
- Lossless v1 → v2 browser-data migration
- Skippable onboarding and bounded guided check-ins
- Local journey-action milestones
- Honest browser-local settings
- Browser-local per-journey Event Manager with change history and concern lifecycle

## PR#0003 — private collaboration candidate

- Separate registration and login accounts with Argon2id password hashing
- Email verification, bounded sessions, recovery, logout, and deletion
- Email-bound invitations and maximum-two-member enforcement
- Private PostgreSQL journeys with version-conflict responses
- Cloud-backed shared moments, conversations to return to, action milestones, and preserved practical records
- Server-authoritative, append-only, actor-attributed, HMAC-chained events
- One portable container for an AWS primary and GCP cold standby
- Threat model, API contract, and operations/restore gates

PR#0003 remains a candidate until production secrets, SMTP, PostgreSQL, backup restore, security review, and the full release gate pass. GitHub Pages is still browser-only.

## Next — hardening and launch

- Optional custom categories and currencies
- Recoverable archive instead of immediate deletion
- Better print and export formats
- Expanded accessibility testing
- Installable PWA metadata and icons
- Durable offline sync and explicit merge UX
- Independent security review and disaster-recovery exercise
- Test-mode Stripe Checkout, Billing, webhook, and entitlement acceptance matrix; Customer Portal waits for the policy decisions tracked in issue 43
- Billing reconciliation, refund/dispute policy, tax decisions, and live-mode release gate

## Later — subscription and native apps

- iOS packaging and App Store release gate
- Android packaging after the web/iOS launch exception
- Additional journeyers are planned, but the current private service still enforces its live membership limit
- Public pricing remains undecided until the additional-journeyer experience, billing boundary, and launch evidence are implementation-ready
- Stripe for direct web purchases only; Apple and Google purchases remain separate store transactions while accounts, journeys, and normalized entitlements stay in the owner-controlled platform

## Not planned

- Relationship scores
- Hidden monitoring or notifications
- Advertising or sale of account or journey data
- Public leaderboards
- Using payment contribution as a proxy for love, fairness, or commitment
